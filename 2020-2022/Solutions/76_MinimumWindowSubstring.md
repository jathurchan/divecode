# 76. Minimum Window Substring

## Description

Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return *the **minimum window substring** of* `s` *such that every character in* `t` *(**including duplicates**) is included in the window. If there is no such substring*_, return the empty string_ `""`*.*

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is **unique**.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"

**Output:** "BANC"

**Explanation:** The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "a", t = "a"

**Output:** "a"

**Explanation:** The entire string s is the minimum window.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "a", t = "aa"

**Output:** ""

**Explanation:** Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.

Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.

**Constraints:**

- `m == s.length`
- `n == t.length`
- `1 <= m, nÂ <= 105`
- `s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

## Thoughts

- Window represented by 2 pointers i and j.
- Start with i = j = 0 (increase the length of window until satisfying the condition by moving j to the right)
- Save the substring corresponding to the window
- try reducing the length of the window by moving i to right until the window is satifying the condition
- Restart and each time a window is satisfying, compare the new window length with the length of the one stored and keep the window with the minimum length.
